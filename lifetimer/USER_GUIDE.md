## Getting Started

Welcome to LifeTimer! This guide will help you make the most of your 1356-day journey to personal transformation.

### What is LifeTimer?

LifeTimer is a gamified life countdown app that helps you achieve your goals through a focused, time-bound challenge. You create a bucket list of up to 20 life goals, start your 1356-day countdown (3 years, 8 months, and 11 days), and commit to making every day count.

### Why 1356 Days?

This timeframe represents the perfect balance between ambition and achievability. It's long enough to accomplish meaningful transformation but short enough to maintain urgency and focus.
